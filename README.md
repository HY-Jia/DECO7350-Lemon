### Team
### Huiyu Jia
My strengths should be serious and responsible. If I want to do something, I will be motivated to do it well. Because I feel that if this is unavoidable and takes time, and it is more meaningful to treat this task seriously than perfunctory. As a team leader, I hope that every member of my team can think so, even if we may have some skills that are not as good as others, this attitude can exceed everything. As for the technical, I am familiar with the prototype design process and related software.

My weakness may be that the position in the team discussion is not firm. When team members discuss the project plan, it is inevitable that different ideas will appear. If these ideas are not conclusive, it will take a lot of time to stand still. At this time, the team leader needs to make a decision. However, I am hesitant most of the time, so sometimes, the team's work efficiency may not be so high. The ability to think independently can be improved. As for the technical, my programming ability is very weak.

Learning through this semester project, my aspirations are team members can learn from each other and collaborate efficiently. From the early exploration and discovery of the domain to the mid-term survey of users to the production of the prototype, I hope that each team member can participate in it and gain knowledge. My goal for this course is to work together on a product with excellent user experience.
### Yuchen Ye
Strength:

* Familiar with prototyping tools, such as XD, Axure, could produce a functional and interactive prototype

* A clear design logic from a holistic perspective

* A pragmatist, consider product’s functions and technical implementation

* Foundations of coding, including C, Python, Java, Unity, basic frontend technologies experience

* Have experience of AR (Augmented Reality)

I like exploring new technologies and apply them when designing products. I think a professional designer needs to consider the technical feasibility and have the empathy to the coders' cause designer cannot be an idealist. I will be responsible for my project and contribute my best, although I know I cannot force others to follow my criteria and standard. My communication ability is fine, I think we could learn a lot through conversations with others having different backgrounds, and each product’s evaluation/iteration procedures are more important than offerings themselves.

Weakness:

Sometimes I feel a little difficult to visualise my ideas and draw them clearly, and it could be an obstacle to express and explain my designs to others. I could imagine that in the following designing procedure, our team needs to make some product sketches, so this is what I want to learn from my team members.

### Guangyao Li

Strength：

* Expertise in various object-oriented programming languages, also involving SQL and PHP.
* Understand a variety of binary classification algorithms and filtering algorithms. These algorithms are helpful for developing our projects and achieving our desired functionalities.
* Have learned much design experience. Meanwhile, I understand we should design user-centred products.
* Understand how to provide more humanised products and help users interact with our product more efficiently.
* Understand the survey process, product design, and prototype progress.
* Positive attitude, highly motivated
* English/write with high proficiency

Weakness：

* UNITY
Currently, I am not very familiar with UNITY. This project provides me with an opportunity for using UNITY to achieve our project aim.

* Huge stress
As the last semester students, I not only have many assignments and Thesis projects but also am required to find a new supervisor for further studying. The huge amount of missions leads a lot of stress.

* Living area
Our four team members are living in different areas in Brisbane. Each team member has different course time and personal assignments. It is challenging for me having enough discussion time me our team members.

### Yawen Deng
Strength:

Familiar with design software, such as adobe illustrator, adobe 3D max, photoshop, adobe XD, keyshot. I can use some programming, such as HTML, CSS, Python, SQL.

Have some design skills, such as hand painting, Graphic Design

Although I can design different kinds of products and use design software to achieve my design before, the interaction is also import between people and products. I want to complete this project with my group members and communicate with members who have more code skills to learn about making products more interactive for people. Today's products are becoming more and more intelligent, and interaction is becoming more and more important.

Weakness:

This class is social mobile, but code usage and knowledge are my weakness, I do not have a professional IT background. I can learn from my group members who have an IT background.
